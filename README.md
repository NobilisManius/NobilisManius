# Hi there, I'm Egor.

## Skills: 
- C++
- Py
- C#

## Projects and activities:
- I work on scripts for various data processing in the semiconductor industry. Mostly in Python, but I often work with C and TCL.
- At the moment I'm reading books on data science, I want to learn how to analyze data. Of course, in university I had to deal with plotting complex graphs or manipulating a lot of values, but it's too simple and I want to go deeper into the subject.
- Learning to use Unity and C#, I have some concepts for games that would be interesting to develop.
